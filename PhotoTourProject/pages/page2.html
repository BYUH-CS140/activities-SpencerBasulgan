        <h4>All about Mayon Volcano</h4>
        <p> 
            <em>Mayon Volcano</em> is a beautiful and famous volcano in the Philippines, known for its almost perfect cone shape. 
            It stands tall and proud, with green forests around its base and a smooth, pointed top. The volcano is active,
            which means it can erupt, and sometimes it sends out smoke, lava, and ash. Even though it can be dangerous,
            many people visit to see its amazing shape and stunning views. Mayon is a natural wonder that shows both the
            beauty and power of nature.

        <h4>Cagsawa Ruins</h4>
        <p>
            <em>Cagsawa Ruins</em> is the best place to take a picture of Mayon Volcano because it shows both the old church 
            and the volcano together. The ruins of the church are quiet and beautiful, and they tell a story from the past. 
            Behind them, you can see the tall and perfect shape of Mayon Volcano. The view is clear and wide, so it is easy 
            to take a good photo. On sunny days, the sky is blue, and the volcano looks even more amazing. The mix of history 
            and nature makes Cagsawa Ruins a perfect and special spot for pictures.
