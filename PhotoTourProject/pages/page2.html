        <h4>All about Mayon Volcano</h4>
        <p> 
            <em>Mayon Volcano</em> is a beautiful and famous volcano in the Philippines, <br>
            known for its almost perfect cone shape. It stands tall and proud, with green <br>
            forests around its base and a smooth, pointed top. The volcano is the most active <br>
            in the country, which means it can erupt any time, and sometimes it sends out smoke, <br>
            lava, and ash. Even though it can be dangerous, many people visit to see its amazing <br>
            shape and stunning views. Mayon is a natural wonder that shows both the beauty and power <br>  
            of nature.

        <h4>Cagsawa Ruins</h4>
        <p>
            <em>Cagsawa Ruins</em> is the best place to take a picture of Mayon Volcano because it shows
            both the old church and the volcano together. The ruins of the church are quiet and beautiful,
            and they tell a story from the past. Behind them, you can see the tall and perfect shape of
            Mayon Volcano. The view is clear and wide, so it is easy to take a good photo. On sunny days, 
            the sky is blue, and the volcano looks even more amazing. The mix of history 
            and nature makes Cagsawa Ruins a perfect and special spot for pictures.
