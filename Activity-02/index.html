            <strong>Heya Guys, It’s Spencer Basulgan!</strong>
            Today I want to talk about why Mobile Legends Bang Bang is a great mobile game.
            Some of you might say that this is a bias article but I will
            prove to you that this is not just any other mobile games out there.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Mobile Legengs Bang Bang</b>
            was released in July 14, 2016, and was mostly played by players from Southeast Asian countries such as
            <em>Philippines and Indonesia. </em>

        </p>
        
        <p>
            Over the years, it attracted more and more players. Currently it has crossed 1 billion downloads,
            with peak monthly players of 100 million. 
            <b>Just imagine that!</b> 
            <strong><mark>ONE BILLION!</mark></strong> 
        </p>

        <p>
            Why 
            <b><abbr title="Mobile Legends Bang Bang">MLBB</abbr> </b>
            is very popular?
            The advantage of this game over other popular games such as 
            <i>League of Legends</i> and 
            <i>DOTA</i> is its accessibility. 
            Almost everyone, even kids, now has a smartphone, and by simply installing this game, they can play something very similar to those popular titles. 
            Another advantage is the shorter playtime—each game lasts an average of only 15 minutes, compared to 30 minutes to an hour for computer games.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another reason why it's very popular especially among teenagers, is because it is catchy.
            And since it is a sci-fi game,  the developers have integrated regional elements into the game—such as heroes inspired by 
            Southeast Asian folklore like the Filipino warrior Lapu-Lapu—strengthening its connection with local audiences.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>MLBB</b>'s thriving esports scene and frequent updates also help maintain engagement and community interest. You can learn more about other folklore characters 
            that were incorporated in this game by visiting this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Legends%3A_Bang_Bang?utm_source=chatgpt.com">link</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, <b>MLBB</b> maintains player engagement through regular updates, 
            introducing new heroes, skins, and balance changes, which keep the gameplay fresh and dynamic. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The game's thriving esports scene, highlighted by events like the 
            <abbr title="Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Professional League"><b>MPL</b></abbr>
            , further contributes to its sustained popularity by fostering a competitive and community-driven environment.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "Over the years, the MPL has cultivated strong support in Southeast Asia, with Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia emerging as major viewership hubs.
                The recently concluded MPL Philippines Season 14 achieved a new record of over 1.6 million peak concurrent viewers, surpassing the previous record of 1.4 million from Season 7 in 2021."

            Last year, it was nominated for Best Esports Game at The Game Awards 2024—one of the most prestigious events in the gaming industry. 
            Among the other nominees were industry giants like 
            <i>League of Legends, Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, and Valorant.</i>
            This recognition places <i>Mobile Legends</i> alongside some of the most iconic titles in competitive gaming, signaling its rise to global prominence.
